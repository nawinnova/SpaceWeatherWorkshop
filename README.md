This repository hosts the code files for the Space Weather Forecasting Workshop as part of SPCE0017 module: Space Data Systems and Processing at UCL.

To run these notebooks, simply click the "Open in Colab" banner. It will redirect you to Google Colab, which allows you to run Python without installing it on your computer. Once you are in Colab, feel free to edit or play around the code as much as you like. The original code won't be affected.
